<p>The ticket exchange app allows students to advertise that they are looking for or selling tickets for common concert events in Hawaii. While similar to Craigslist, the app will focus more on the following features:

Students must login with their UH credentials to access the system.
There is no anonymity: buyers and sellers connect through their UH credentials.
Transactions can be made off campus but it is preferred to be on campus. This can be specified in each post
Because this app is only for UHM students, concert tickets will be limited to concert events on Oahu only
Students who violate the terms of use for the system can be banned by locking out their UH ID.</p>
